# MtbImporter

MtbImporter is a tool that eases the data integration, management and import of both clinical and mutational data into [cBioPortal](https://cbioportal.org).
It is tested and optimized to work with the core components of the MIRACUM UseCase 3 *Support for Molecular Tumor Boards*, which are available here:

- [MIRACUM-cBioPortal](https://github.com/buschlab/MIRACUM-cBioPortal)
- [MIRACUM-Pipe](https://github.com/AG-Boerries/MIRACUM-Pipe) (v3.0.0 and upwards)

To account for the huge variety of clinical source systems, this tool relies on csv files as input format and uses Metadata Repositories to store data model descriptions and their relations in a source code independent way.

If you want to consume FHIR resources, you will need to flatten them first to a csv based format using tools like [FhirExtinguisher](https://github.com/JohannesOehm/FhirExtinguisher) or [fhircrackr](https://github.com/POLAR-fhiR/fhircrackr).

## Core features

- Automatic detection of input data type
- Supports the following MDRs
    - [Kairos CentraXX MDR](https://www.kairos.de/knowledge-base/produkt/mdr/) (commercial product)
    - [Samply MDR](https://bitbucket.org/medicalinformatics/samply.mdr/src/master/src/site/markdown/index.md) (AGPL-3.0)
    - [DataElementHub](https://github.com/mig-frankfurt/dataelementhub.rest) (AGPL-3.0), see [here](https://github.com/nr23730/dataelementhub-deploy) for Docker deployment
- Annotation of data columns using metadata repository (MDR)
- Code independent data transformation through MDR and Groovy scripts
- Translation of ICD-O-3 classification to OncoTree using FHIR Terminology services
- Further annotation of poorly described variants through VEP
- Record linkage on clinical and mutation data
- Studies are split by presentation date of the patient
- Versioned data management
- Composes a complete cBioPortal study, compatible to the default import format
- Lineage of import process and restart afterwards
- Runs native on JVM 17, Docker and Docker-Compose

## Get started

General assumption: The tools relies on the fact that the mutation data uses the sample id as identifier and that the patient id can be resolved from a FHIR repository.

For a minimal data model description of cBioPortal that covers all attributes provided by the pipeline see [here](https://mdr.itcr.uni-luebeck.de/view.xhtml?namespace=cbioportal).
We also provide a working test dataset for both clinical and mutational data [here](https://github.com/buschlab/MIRACUM-cbioportal/tree/master/tools/MtbImporter/testdata). 

To get started, copy the `settings.yaml.example` file to `settings.yaml`. This avoids future conflicts within the git tree. You need to tailor the configuration parameters to fit your environment first. The following configuration parameters are available:

  -
    source: orbis_l-tumorboard-molekular
    target: cbioportal_patient
    modelClass: de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.ClinicalPatient
```

The following model classes are availabe:
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.ClinicalPatient
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.ClinicalSample
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.Cna
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.ContinuousCna
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.GenePanelMatrix
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.Maf
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.SampleResource
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.Timeline
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.TimelineImaging
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.TimelineLabtest
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.TimelineSpecimen
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.TimelineStatus
- de.uzl.lied.mtbimporter.model.TimelineTreatment

There are two special fields for clinical data, that can be used as a mapping target: `ICD_O_3_SITE` and `ICD_O_3_HISTOLOGY` if these attributes are present MtbImporter will try to map the ICD-O-3 classification to OncoTree resulting in the additional columns `ONCOTREE_CODE` and `CANCER_TYPE`.

### Preparation

Each file go through a preparation process. This will generate Map, indexed by the patient id. It can be used to cache information that might be relevant for the whole mapping process. 
In this [example](https://github.com/buschlab/MtbImporter/blob/main/mapper/prepare.groovy) the year and month of first diagnosis is stored. Later it can be used to calculate relative timestamps in timelines or survival times.

### Mapping using Kairos CentraXX MDR

Source and target are forms/profiles/itemsets defined in your CXX MDR. To do an actual data conversion you also have to define *Relations* between the definitions in source and target.

Here *Element A* was selected form the source system, while *Element B* belongs to the target system.

By clicking on the Transformation *A -> B* you'll be able to define a Groovy script that transforms the element from data model *A* to data model *B*.

### Mapping using Samply MDR

Values other than `equal` will be mapped on the fly using Groovy scripts. Those have to be stored in the `mappers` folder within a subfolder for each dataelementgroup. The currently processed variable is accessible as `src`, all other variables are accessible using their identifier in the csv file, but with an underscore as prefix.

Example: You want to map the attribute `NACHNAME` from your source system to the attribute `PATIENT_DISPLAY_NAME` for a patient in cBioPortal. Your Concepts section for the dataelement `NACHNAME` within Samply MDR will look like this:
![](figures/samply-concepts.png)

Your mapping script will be located at the following path and look like this:
`mappers/cbioportal_patient/nachname.groovy`
```
_VORNAME + " " + src
```

### Mapping using DataElementHub

Values other than `equal` will be mapped on the fly using Groovy scripts. Those have to be stored in the `mappers` folder within a subfolder for each dataelementgroup. The currently processed variable is accessible as `src`, all other variables are accessible using their identifier in the csv file, but with an underscore as prefix.

Example: You want to map the attribute `NACHNAME` from your source system to the attribute `PATIENT_DISPLAY_NAME` for a patient in cBioPortal. Your Concepts section for the dataelement `NACHNAME` within DataElementHub will look like this:
![](figures/dataelementhub-concepts.png)

Your mapping script will be located at the following path and look like this:
`mappers/cbioportal_patient/nachname.groovy`
```
_VORNAME + " " + src
```
